# Project Context
A comprehensive real-time net worth dashboard that aggregates financial data from multiple sources using a plugin architecture for easy extensibility.

## Development Guidelines

## Task Behaviors
When updating or creating code, Claude should always:
- Include comments for non-trivial logic.
- Reflect major changes or new features and functionality in the README
- When creating new API endpoints, make sure they are annotated for swagger so that documentation can be generated from it

## Review Expectations
- If unsure about a change, ask instead of guessing.

## Safety Constraints
- Do not remove or break any functionality unless you are explicitly asked to do so 

## Debugging
- When asked to fix an issue, always look very carefully at all related code and try to find the root cause.  Do not implement quick fixes, find the root cause of the issue and fix that as elegantly and maintainably as possible.  This should prevent muliple iterations that do not fix the issure or make things worse.
