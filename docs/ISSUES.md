# TODOs
* The edit option for manual entries says functionality will be available in the future. Implement edit.
* Under "Equity Compensation" on stocks page, data source is blank for rsus
* Stocks page missing current price in "equity compensation"
* Stocks page needs a refresh button as well, similar to Dashboard page
* "Recent Activity" is showing fake data.  Devise a mechanism for putting the real activity here.  One way would be to have a database table that has an audit log of user actions, and this table can show a one line indication of the last things the user did.
* "Accounts" page has no content yet
* "Settings" page is empty.  What types of configuration settings will eventually go here?
